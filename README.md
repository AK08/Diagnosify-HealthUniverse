### Inspiration <img src="images/inspo.png" alt="png" width="30">
The inspiration behind the creation of Diagnosify stems from the pressing need for more accurate, efficient, and accessible methods of brain disease diagnosis in the modern healthcare landscape. The convergence of medical expertise and technological advancements has the potential to revolutionize the way diseases are detected and treated. Several key factors have motivated the inception of Diagnosify:

1. <b>Early Detection and Intervention: </b> Timely detection of diseases is often a critical factor in determining patient outcomes. Many medical conditions, such as brain tumors and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, can exhibit subtle symptoms in their early stages. Diagnosify seeks to provide healthcare professionals with tools that enable them to identify these diseases at an early phase, leading to more effective treatment strategies and improved patient quality of life.

2. <b>Limited Resources and Expertise: </b>In various regions around the world, access to specialized medical expertise is limited, especially in rural or underserved areas. Diagnosify's technology-driven approach aims to bridge this gap by providing medical professionals with supplementary diagnostic tools. These tools can aid in making accurate assessments and decisions, even in areas with fewer medical resources.

3. <b>Technological Advancements in Medical Imaging: </b> The rapid advancements in medical imaging technologies, such as MRI, CT scans, and dermatological imaging, have led to an abundance of data that can potentially be harnessed for disease diagnosis. Diagnosify leverages these technologies to analyze intricate medical images and data, extracting valuable insights that can aid in disease classification.

### Social Impact <img src="images/impact.png" alt="png" width="30">
The "Diagnosify - HealthUniverse" project has the potential to create significant social impact in several ways:

1. Early Detection and Treatment: By accurately predicting diseases like brain tumors, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's Disease, the project can enable early detection and intervention. Early diagnosis often leads to more effective treatment options and improved patient outcomes.
2. Healthcare Access: Diagnosify can extend medical expertise to underserved and remote areas where access to specialized healthcare may be limited. This democratization of medical diagnosis can ensure that individuals in various geographical locations receive timely and accurate predictions.
3. Reduced Misdiagnosis: Machine learning algorithms used in the project can help reduce instances of misdiagnosis by analyzing intricate patterns that might be challenging for human experts to identify. This can prevent unnecessary treatments and procedures while increasing the accuracy of diagnoses.

4. Collaborative Healthcare: The project promotes collaboration between medical professionals and technology. This synergy can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of diseases and their characteristics, fostering a collaborative approach to healthcare.

<!-- Intel one api -->
## Intel® oneAPI
Intel® OneAPI is a comprehensive development platform for building high-performance, cross-architecture applications. It provides a unified programming model, tools, and libraries that allow developers to optimize their applications for Intel® CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and other hardware. Intel® OneAPI includes support for popular programming languages like C++, Python, and Fortran, as well as frameworks for deep learning, high-performance computing, and data analytics. With Intel® OneAPI, developers can build applications that can run on a variety of hardware platforms, and take advantage of the performance benefits of Intel® architectures.
<!-- Use of oneAPI in our project -->
### Use of oneAPI in our project

In this section, we'll outline how we utilized various Intel® oneAPI libraries and frameworks to enhance the performance and efficiency of our models.

* <b>Intel® oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL)</b>

The oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) is a versatile machine learning library that accelerates big data analysis at all stages of the pipeline. To leverage the power of oneDAL, We employed the Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn*, an integral part of oneDAL that enhances existing scikit-learn code by patching it.

Installation:
<code>pip install scikit-learn-intelex</code> 

Usage:<br>
<code>from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
patch_sklearn()</code>

By integrating Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn*, We achieved substantial acceleration, with performance gains ranging from 10x to 100x across various applications.

* <b>Intel® oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)</b>

To optimize deep learning applications on Intel® CPUs and GPUs, We integrated the oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN). To enable oneDNN optimizations for TensorFlow* running on Intel® hardware, We used the following code:

<code>os.environ['TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS'] = '1'
os.environ['DNNL_ENGINE_LIMIT_CPU_CAPABILITIES'] = '0'</code> 

Before training our models, We disabled the system allocator using the following code to enhance performance:

<code>os.environ['TF_ONEDNN_USE_SYSTEM_ALLOCATOR'] = '0'</code>

After training and before inference, We re-enabled the system allocator using:

<code>os.environ['TF_ONEDNN_USE_SYSTEM_ALLOCATOR'] = '1'</code>

Moreover, We assumed frozen weights for inference using:

<code>os.environ['TF_ONEDNN_ASSUME_FROZEN_WEIGHTS'] = '1'</code>

* <b>Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL)</b>

The Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Library (oneDPL) aims to simplify SYCL* programming efforts across devices for high-performance parallel applications. We harnessed the power of oneDPL using specific environment variables to optimize performance and memory utilization.

<code>os.environ['ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR'] = 'opencl:*'
os.environ['SYCL_ENABLE_DEFAULT_CONTEXTS'] = '1'
os.environ['SYCL_ENABLE_FUSION_CACHING'] = '1'</code>

* <b>Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit)</b>

The Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) offers an integrated solution for preprocessing, machine learning, and model development. To optimize deep learning training on Intel® XPUs and streamline inference, We utilized the toolkit's Intel®-optimized deep-learning frameworks for TensorFlow*.

<code>pip install --upgrade intel-extension-for-tensorflow[cpu]</code>

We set the backend type to CPU for Intel® Tensorflow Operator Optimization:

<code>os.environ['ITEX_XPU_BACKEND'] = 'CPU'</code>

And enabled Advanced Automatic Mixed Precision for improved inference speed and reduced memory consumption:

<code>os.environ['ITEX_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION'] = '1'</code>

#### Model Specifics and Usage
Alzheimer's Disease Prediction and Brain Tumor Detection models are TensorFlow-based. For these, We used the Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* from the AI Kit, oneDAL, oneDPL and oneDNN to enhance performance. Parkinson's Disease Detector was optimized using the Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn from oneDAL.
